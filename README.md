I'm **Jazeel Jabbar**, an entrepreneur and tech innovator passionate about building AI-driven solutions that make a real impact. Currently, Iâ€™m working on **HopeLog** , an empathetic AI journaling tool designed to support people dealing with depression and anxiety. My goal is to create a virtual companion that helps users navigate their mental health journey while maintaining privacy and trust.

In the past, I founded Camel Central, an online art and craft education platform, and True Eyes, an interactive advertising technology company. Iâ€™ve also won multiple awards, including the UAE Web Awards and Pan Arab Awards, and have been part of startup programs like Founder Institute and ISLabs.

Now, Iâ€™m focused on growing HopeLog into a global mental wellness platform while sharing my entrepreneurial journey on Substack and Medium. I believe in building products that genuinely help people, and Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s ahead. ðŸš€
